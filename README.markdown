Why?
----

I needed to add Previous/Next/Done buttons in the input accessory view for most text fields/views. While I found several projects that already do this, none of them appeared to automatically adjust the positioning of the view or work correctly with a UITableView instance (since they depended on all of the input views being available on view load while a table view's cells are lazily loaded.)

What?
-----

JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView allows to add an input accessory view to your view controllers that contains Previous/Next/Done buttons. Once configured with a list of responding items, the JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView instance allows the user to cycle through the inputs (as Safari allows in a web form) and automatically ensures that the view is positioned so that the keyboard doesn't hide the input's view.

Example Code?

A working sample iOS Xcode project is available in the `Demo` directory.

Usage?
----

Note: If you'd like to configure your own toolbar buttons (say, for example, to take advantage of this projects view scrolling code without the next/previous buttons), you can configure the accessory view via its `delegate`. The accessory view itself adopts the delegate protocol and is the default delegate so that a custom delegate is not necessary.

    #import "JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView.h"
    #import "JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryViewResponderItem.h"
    
    @interface MyTableViewController : UITableViewController
    
    @property (strong, nonatomic) JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView* inputAccessoryView;
    
    @end
    
    @implementation MyTableViewController
    
    - (void) viewDidLoad {
      [super viewDidLoad];
      
      self.inputAccessoryView = [JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView defaultFormInputAccessoryView];
      
      NSMutableArray* responders = [NSMutableArray new];
      NSUInteger sectionCount = [self.tableView.dataSource numberOfSectionsInTableView:self.tableView];
      for (NSInteger section = 0; section < sectionCount; ++section) {
        NSUInteger rowCount = [self.tableView.dataSource tableView:self.tableView numberOfRowsInSection:section];
        for (NSInteger row = 0; row < rowCount; ++row) {
          NSIndexPath* indexPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:row inSection:section];
          JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryViewRespondingViewGetter respondingViewGetter = ^UIView *{
            UITableViewCell* cell = [self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
            UITextField* textField;
            for (UIView* subview in cell.contentView.subviews) {
              if ([subview isKindOfClass:[UITextField class]]) {
                textField = (UITextField*)subview;
                break;
              }
            }
            return textField;
          };
          [responders addObject:[JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryViewResponderItem itemWithContainingTableView:self.tableView
                                                                                                indexPath:indexPath
                                                                                     respondingViewGetter:respondingViewGetter]];
        }
      }
      self.inputAccessoryView.responders = responders;
    }
    
    @end
    

Help! The Keyboard Doesn't Dismiss: Modal Form Sheets on the iPad
-------------------------------------------------------

iOS intentionally does not hide the keyboard on the iPad when a modal form sheet is displayed even if the text input has resigned first responder status. This is by design according to filed RADARs. However, there is a way to override this behavior: the presented UIViewController in the modal form sheet needs to return `NO` from `- (BOOL) disablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissal`. This is not a settable property, so you can override it on all UIViewController instances via a category, or use the category shown below to allow setting the value on a per-instance level. Note: if you use this category, make sure you set the overridden value on the base controller being presented in the modal, even if that base controller is a navigation controller.

UIViewController+JCViewControllerHelpers.h

    #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
    
    @interface UIViewController (JCViewControllerHelpers)
    
    - (void) setDisablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissal:(BOOL)disableDismissal;
    
    @end

UIViewController+JCViewControllerHelpers.m

    #import "UIViewController+KCViewControllerHelpers.h"
    #import <objc/runtime.h>
    
    @implementation UIViewController (JCViewControllerHelpers)
    
    + (void) load {
      // Swizzling code from http://stackoverflow.com/a/5372042/1114761
      SEL originalSelector = @selector(disablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissal);
      SEL overrideSelector = @selector(JC_disablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissal);
      Method originalMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(self, originalSelector);
      Method overrideMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(self, overrideSelector);
      if (class_addMethod(self, originalSelector, method_getImplementation(overrideMethod), method_getTypeEncoding(overrideMethod))) {
        class_replaceMethod(self, overrideSelector, method_getImplementation(originalMethod), method_getTypeEncoding(originalMethod));
      } else {
        method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, overrideMethod);
      }
    }
    
    static char disablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissalKey;
    - (void) setDisablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissal:(BOOL)disableDismissal {
      objc_setAssociatedObject(self, &disablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissalKey, @(disableDismissal), OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN_NONATOMIC);
    }
    
    - (BOOL) JC_disablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissal {
      NSNumber* overriddenValue = objc_getAssociatedObject(self, &disablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissalKey);
      if (overriddenValue) {
        return [overriddenValue boolValue];
      } else {
        return self.disablesAutomaticKeyboardDismissal;
      }
    }
    
    @end

Installation?
-------------

This project includes a `podspec` for usage with [CocoaPods](http://http://cocoapods.org/). Simply add

    pod 'JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView'

to your `Podfile` and run `pod install`.

Alternately, you can add all of the files contained in this project's `Library` directory to your Xcode project. If your project does not use ARC, you will need to enable ARC on these files. You can enable ARC per-file by adding the -fobjc-arc flag, as described on [a common StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6646052/how-can-i-disable-arc-for-a-single-file-in-a-project).
